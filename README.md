This is a simple game I made that I have made that is supposed to allow you to play monopoly on your computer. It is text based. 
I created this project with Java code. In this project, I used system inputs to take the users decision, I create objects representing each square on a monopoly board, I create arrays to store the board, players, and other such item.
I created this project as a way to practice my java programming skills. I really like monopoly so I decided to create this game to test the limits of my coding skills.
